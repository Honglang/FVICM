# FVICM: Functional varying-index coefficients model for dynamic synergistic gene-environment interactions
This code implements the genetic association studeis via QIF with functional trait using functional varying-index coefficient models.

## Three files

* FVICM_Order_Selection.R: This file is about model selection, in particular for the order of the spline used.

* FVICM_Estimation.R: This file provide one example for estimation proposed in the paper.

* FVICM_Testing.R: This file provides one example for testing procedure in the papar. In particular, this example provides the calculation of the power of the testing procedure.
